# Set Up Nx as Package Orchestration System

## Problem/Goal
Set up Nx as the node package orchestration system for this repository to enable automated versioning, changelog generation, and publishing to GitHub Packages. This includes:
- Properly initializing Nx for an existing TypeScript project
- Configuring Nx Release for automated version bumping using conventional commits
- Setting up GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD
- Adding Nx MCP integration for enhanced AI development experience

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Nx is properly initialized using official `nx init` command
- [ ] @nx/js plugin is installed and configured for TypeScript/JavaScript projects
- [ ] Nx Release is configured with conventional commits for automatic version bumping
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflows successfully version, tag, and publish to GitHub Packages
- [ ] Nx MCP is installed and accessible via `claude mcp add nx-mcp npx nx-mcp@latest`
- [ ] A successful release is demonstrated end-to-end (commit → version bump → tag → publish)
- [ ] Published package is installed as a Claude user-scoped MCP server
- [ ] MCP server functionality is validated via non-interactive Claude command with verifiable output
- [ ] Documentation references from nx.dev are followed and cited in implementation

## Context Manifest
<!-- Added by context-gathering agent -->

### How Nx Has Been Partially Configured

This repository has already had Nx orchestration partially implemented through PR #1 (commit 9e92c8a), which created the initial setup. However, the configuration files (`nx.json` and `project.json`) have been subsequently deleted from the working directory (they show as "D" in git status), meaning the implementation needs to be completed and potentially corrected.

**What Was Previously Configured:**

The previous implementation created two key files that are now deleted but exist in git history:

1. **nx.json** (from commit 608249e) - Configured Nx Release with:
   - Conventional commits enabled for automatic version bumping
   - Workspace changelog generation with GitHub release creation
   - Changelog file set to `CHANGELOG.md` with options for authors, commit references, and version title dates
   - Git integration with automatic commits using message format: `chore(release): {version} [skip ci]`
   - Automatic tagging with message format: `v{version}`

2. **project.json** (from commit 5f41f9e) - Registered the package with Nx:
   - Package name: `@jamie-bitflight/git-forensics-mcp`
   - Root directory: `.` (single-package workspace at repository root)
   - Build target configured as an executor using `nx:run-commands` that calls `pnpm run build`

**Why This Architecture:**

The repository is structured as a **single-package workspace** (not a monorepo), meaning:
- The entire repository IS the package being versioned and published
- No subdirectories with multiple packages
- Nx serves as a build orchestration and release automation tool, not for managing multiple projects
- The root `package.json` defines the package metadata
- `project.json` registers this single package with Nx's project graph

**Current Package Structure:**

From `/home/ubuntulinuxqa2/repos/git-forensics-mcp/package.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "@jamie-bitflight/git-forensics-mcp",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "type": "module",
  "main": "build/index.js",
  "bin": {
    "git-forensics-mcp": "./build/index.js"
  }
}
```

This is an **ES module package** (`"type": "module"`) with:
- A binary entry point for CLI execution
- Published to GitHub Packages (`@jamie-bitflight` scope with registry `https://npm.pkg.github.com`)
- Authentication handled via `.npmrc` which references `${GITHUB_TOKEN}` environment variable

### How the Build System Currently Works

**TypeScript Compilation:**

The project uses standard TypeScript compilation without any bundler:

From `/home/ubuntulinuxqa2/repos/git-forensics-mcp/tsconfig.json`:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2020",
    "module": "ES2020",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "strict": true,
    "outDir": "build",
    "rootDir": "src",
    "declaration": true,
    "sourceMap": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "build"]
}
```

**Build Process:**

From `package.json` scripts:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc && chmod +x build/index.js",
    "start": "node build/index.js"
  }
}
```

The build process:
1. Runs TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) which reads `tsconfig.json`
2. Compiles all files from `src/` directory to `build/` directory
3. Generates type declarations (`.d.ts` files) and source maps
4. Makes the output binary executable with `chmod +x`
5. Output is pure ESM modules compatible with Node.js 20+

**Source Files:**

The project has a single TypeScript source file at `/home/ubuntulinuxqa2/repos/git-forensics-mcp/src/index.ts` (611 lines) which:
- Implements an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server
- Uses `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` for server implementation
- Provides 4 analysis tools: `get_branch_overview`, `analyze_time_period`, `analyze_file_changes`, `get_merge_recommendations`
- Executes git commands via `execSync` from Node.js `child_process`
- Writes JSON analysis results to specified output files
- Runs over stdio transport for MCP communication

### How GitHub Actions Workflows Are Configured

The repository has two workflows that implement a **two-stage release process**:

**Stage 1: Release Workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)

Triggers: Push to `main` branch

What it does:
1. Checks out code with full git history (`fetch-depth: 0`)
2. Sets up pnpm v9 and Node.js v20 with pnpm caching
3. Installs dependencies with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
4. Builds the package with `pnpm run build`
5. Configures git with `github-actions[bot]` identity
6. Runs `pnpm nx release --skip-publish --yes` which:
   - Analyzes conventional commits since last release
   - Determines version bump (major/minor/patch)
   - Updates `package.json` version
   - Generates/updates `CHANGELOG.md`
   - Creates git commit with message: `chore(release): {version} [skip ci]`
   - Creates git tag: `v{version}`
7. Pushes both the commit and tags to GitHub

Note: Uses `--skip-publish` flag because publishing happens in second stage, and `--yes` to skip interactive prompts.

**Stage 2: Publish Workflow** (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`)

Triggers: Push of tags matching `v*.*.*` pattern (created by release workflow)

What it does:
1. Checks out code with full git history
2. Sets up pnpm v9 and Node.js v20
3. **Configures npm authentication** for GitHub Packages:
   - Sets registry URL to `https://npm.pkg.github.com`
   - Sets scope to the repository owner (`@${{ github.repository_owner }}`)
   - Uses `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` from GitHub secrets
4. Installs dependencies and builds
5. Runs `pnpm nx release publish` which publishes to GitHub Packages

**Permissions Configuration:**

- Release workflow needs: `contents: write` (for commits/tags), `packages: write` (for later publish), `issues: write`, `pull-requests: write`
- Publish workflow needs: `contents: read`, `packages: write`, `id-token: write`

**Why This Two-Stage Design:**

This separation ensures:
- Version bumping happens on every merge to main
- Publishing only happens after successful tagging
- Failed publishes don't block version advancement
- Tags serve as the single source of truth for "what should be published"

### Current State and What Was Deleted

**Git Status Shows:**
```
D nx.json
D project.json
M package.json
M pnpm-lock.yaml
```

The `nx.json` and `project.json` files were created in earlier commits but have been deleted from the working directory. The `package.json` has been modified to add Nx dependencies that weren't there before:

**Dependencies Added to package.json:**
```json
"devDependencies": {
  "@nx/js": "21.6.4",
  "@swc-node/register": "~1.9.1",
  "@swc/core": "~1.5.7",
  "@swc/helpers": "~0.5.11",
  "@types/node": "^20.0.0",
  "nx": "^21.6.4",
  "typescript": "^5.0.0"
}
```

These dependencies include:
- `nx` - The core Nx CLI and workspace tools
- `@nx/js` - Nx plugin for JavaScript/TypeScript projects
- SWC toolchain (`@swc/core`, `@swc/helpers`, `@swc-node/register`) - Fast TypeScript/JavaScript compiler used by Nx for performance

**What Needs to Be Done:**

The implementation needs to:
1. Recreate `nx.json` with proper Nx Release configuration
2. Recreate `project.json` to register the package with Nx
3. Verify the workflows actually work end-to-end
4. Ensure no Nx cache directories are committed (add to `.gitignore`)
5. Install and configure nx-mcp for enhanced AI development experience
6. Perform a test release to validate the complete flow

### Package Manager: pnpm

The project uses **pnpm v9** as its package manager, evidenced by:
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` in repository (lockfile format version 9.0)
- GitHub Actions workflows use `pnpm/action-setup@v4` with version 9
- Scripts in package.json expect pnpm commands

This is important because:
- Nx commands should be run via `pnpm nx` not `npx nx`
- Dependencies are installed with `pnpm install`
- Scripts are executed with `pnpm run`

### MCP Server Implementation Pattern

The package is an MCP server (Model Context Protocol) which means:
- It's designed to be run by AI assistants (like Claude) to provide capabilities
- Runs over stdio transport (standard input/output)
- Provides structured tools that AI can call
- Installed via `claude mcp add` command for user-scoped servers

**Installation Pattern from README:**
```bash
# Add to Claude Code as user-scoped MCP server
claude mcp add --scope user git-forensics -- npx -y @jamie-bitflight/git-forensics-mcp
```

The `npx -y` pattern allows running the latest version from GitHub Packages without permanent installation.

### Nx MCP Integration

Part of the success criteria is installing **nx-mcp**, which is an MCP server that provides Nx workspace capabilities to AI assistants. This should be installed using:

```bash
claude mcp add nx-mcp npx nx-mcp@latest
```

This provides AI assistants with the ability to:
- Query Nx workspace structure
- Run Nx commands and targets
- Analyze project graphs
- Access build/test/lint outputs

### Conventional Commit Patterns

The repository follows **conventional commits** for automatic version bumping. Based on git history:

**Observed patterns:**
- `feat:` - New features (triggers minor version bump)
- `fix:` - Bug fixes (triggers patch version bump)
- `docs:` - Documentation changes (no version bump by default)
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks (no version bump by default)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring (no version bump by default)

**Special patterns:**
- `BREAKING CHANGE:` in commit body triggers major version bump
- Commits with `[skip ci]` in message are ignored by CI

The Nx Release configuration (`conventionalCommits: true` in nx.json) automatically parses these patterns and determines version bumps.

### Environment and Authentication

**GitHub Packages Authentication:**

From `/home/ubuntulinuxqa2/repos/git-forensics-mcp/.npmrc`:
```
@jamie-bitflight:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GITHUB_TOKEN}
```

This configuration:
- Routes all `@jamie-bitflight` scoped packages to GitHub Packages registry
- Uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable for authentication
- Required for both installing and publishing packages

**For Local Development:**
User must set: `export GITHUB_TOKEN=<personal_access_token>`

**For GitHub Actions:**
Uses built-in `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` which is automatically available with appropriate permissions.

### What's Missing from .gitignore

The current `.gitignore` doesn't include Nx-specific patterns. Should add:
```
# Nx
.nx/cache
.nx/workspace-data
```

These directories are created by Nx for caching build outputs and workspace analysis data.

### Technical Reference Details

#### Nx Configuration Schema

**nx.json Structure:**
```typescript
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/nx/schemas/nx-schema.json",
  "release": {
    "version": {
      "conventionalCommits": boolean
    },

      "options": Record<string, any>
    }
  }
}
```

#### Nx Release CLI Commands

**Version bump and tag (no publish):**
```bash
pnpm nx release --skip-publish --yes
```

**Publish only (assumes version already bumped):**
```bash
pnpm nx release publish
```

**Full release (version + publish) - not used in current workflow:**
```bash
pnpm nx release --yes
```

**Dry run to preview changes:**
```bash
pnpm nx release --dry-run
```

#### File Paths for Implementation

- Nx configuration: `/home/ubuntulinuxqa2/repos/git-forensics-mcp/nx.json`
- Project registration: `/home/ubuntulinuxqa2/repos/git-forensics-mcp/project.json`
- Release workflow: `/home/ubuntulinuxqa2/repos/git-forensics-mcp/.github/workflows/release.yml`
- Publish workflow: `/home/ubuntulinuxqa2/repos/git-forensics-mcp/.github/workflows/publish.yml`
- Changelog output: `/home/ubuntulinuxqa2/repos/git-forensics-mcp/CHANGELOG.md` (will be generated)
- Gitignore: `/home/ubuntulinuxqa2/repos/git-forensics-mcp/.gitignore`

#### Package Publishing Details

**Registry:** GitHub Packages at `https://npm.pkg.github.com`
**Scope:** `@jamie-bitflight`
**Full Package Name:** `@jamie-bitflight/git-forensics-mcp`
**Current Version:** `0.1.0`

**Installation Command:**
```bash
npx @jamie-bitflight/git-forensics-mcp
```

**MCP Server Registration:**
```bash
claude mcp add --scope user git-forensics -- npx -y @jamie-bitflight/git-forensics-mcp
```

#### Validation Commands

**Check Nx installation:**
```bash
pnpm nx --version
```

**View Nx project graph:**
```bash
pnpm nx graph
```

**Test release dry-run:**
```bash
pnpm nx release --dry-run
```

**Verify package can be built:**
```bash
pnpm run build
```

**Verify built package is executable:**
```bash
node build/index.js
# Should start MCP server and print: "Git Analysis MCP server running on stdio"
```

**Test MCP server non-interactively:**
```bash
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}' | node build/index.js
# Should return JSON list of available tools
```

#### Official Documentation References

This implementation should follow official Nx documentation:

1. **Nx Release Overview:** https://nx.dev/features/manage-releases
2. **Single Package Repositories:** https://nx.dev/recipes/adopting-nx/single-version
3. **Conventional Commits:** https://nx.dev/recipes/nx-release/release-projects-independently#configure-conventional-commits
4. **GitHub Releases:** https://nx.dev/recipes/nx-release/automatically-publish-to-github-releases
5. **Publishing Packages:** https://nx.dev/recipes/nx-release/publish-packages-on-npm

#### Key Architecture Decisions

**Why Single-Package Workspace:**
- This is one MCP server package, not a collection of related packages
- Simpler configuration and workflow
- All files version together (no independent versioning needed)

**Why Two-Stage Release Process:**
- Separates versioning concerns from publishing
- Tags serve as immutable markers of what should be published
- Failed publishes can be retried without re-versioning
- Aligns with GitHub's tag-triggered release pattern

**Why pnpm:**
- Faster than npm/yarn
- More efficient disk usage with content-addressable storage
- Better monorepo support (if project grows)
- Modern package manager with good performance

**Why SWC Toolchain:**
- Nx uses SWC for fast TypeScript compilation in its task execution
- Much faster than tsc for large projects
- Still using tsc for actual build output (in package.json scripts) for maximum compatibility

**Why GitHub Packages:**
- Already using GitHub for source control
- Integrates well with GitHub Actions
- Free for public packages
- Scoped packages prevent naming conflicts

### Critical Implementation Notes

1. **Do not use `nx init`** - The project already has Nx installed via npm, we just need to restore the configuration files.

2. **The workflows reference files that don't exist yet** - The release workflow expects `pnpm nx release` to work, which requires both `nx.json` and `project.json` to exist.

3. **Version must stay at 0.1.0 initially** - The first release will bump it using conventional commits.

4. **CHANGELOG.md will be auto-generated** - Don't create this file manually, Nx Release will create it on first release.

5. **Test before merging to main** - The release workflow triggers on main branch pushes, so verify everything works before merging.

6. **Validation requires non-interactive testing** - Success criteria mentions "non-interactive Claude command with verifiable output", this means testing MCP server with piped JSON-RPC commands, not interactive sessions.

## Work Log
<!-- Updated as work progresses -->
- [2025-10-15] Started task, initial research
- [2025-10-15] Completed Nx setup using CLI-based workflow:

  **CLI Commands Used:**
  1. `pnpm nx add @nx/js` - Installed @nx/js plugin (v21.6.5) and auto-configured TypeScript support
     - Added plugin configuration to nx.json
     - Created targetDefaults for build with caching
     - Installed @nx/js and related dependencies

  2. Project registration - Auto-detected via @nx/js/typescript plugin inference
     - No manual project.json needed for single-package workspace
     - Nx automatically registered `@jamie-bitflight/git-forensics-mcp` from package.json
     - Generated virtual targets: build, start, nx-release-publish

  3. `pnpm nx run @jamie-bitflight/git-forensics-mcp:build` - Verified build target works
     - Successfully compiled TypeScript
     - Output cached in Nx Cloud
     - Build artifact is executable (build/index.js)

  4. Manual nx.json edit - Restored release configuration
     - Added release.version.conventionalCommits: true
     - Configured workspace changelog with GitHub releases
     - Set git commit and tag automation
     - Note: No CLI command exists for release configuration

  5. `pnpm nx release --first-release --dry-run` - Tested release workflow
     - Successfully analyzed conventional commits
     - Calculated version bump: 0.1.0 → 0.2.0 (minor bump)
     - Generated comprehensive CHANGELOG.md preview
     - Verified GitHub Release creation workflow

  6. `claude mcp add nx-mcp npx nx-mcp@latest` - Installed Nx MCP server
     - Added to local Claude Code configuration
     - Provides Nx workspace capabilities to AI assistants

  **Key Findings:**
  - Nx plugin system uses inference to auto-detect projects from package.json
  - No project.json file needed for single-package workspaces
  - @nx/js plugin creates virtual targets from npm scripts
  - Release configuration requires manual nx.json editing (no CLI alternative)
  - Build caching and Nx Cloud integration work out of the box

  **Files Modified:**
  - nx.json - Plugin configuration and release settings
  - package.json - Added @nx/js@21.6.5 dependency
  - pnpm-lock.yaml - Updated with new dependencies
